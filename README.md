Welcome to my Django Marketplace API project! This project provides a comprehensive RESTful API built using Django and Django REST Framework, empowering users to seamlessly register, list products for sale, and purchase items within a secure and efficient environment. As of now, the project is actively under development, with plans to incorporate additional features such as real-time chatting functionality, diverse payment options, and the ability to authenticate via popular social media platforms.


Getting Started:

To run the project locally on your machine, follow these simple steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine using Git. You can do this by running
the following command in your terminal:

    git clone https://github.com/tarekzaki115/ecommerce-.git

Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

Install Dependencies:
Once the virtual environment is activated, install the project dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file. You can do this using pip:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Development Server:
After installing the dependencies, you're ready to run the development server. Execute the following command:

    python manage.py runserver

This will start the Django development server, and you can access the project at localhost:8000/ in your web browser.
